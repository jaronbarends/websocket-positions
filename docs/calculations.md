We'll use the first 3 users to establisch our base triangle;
for AB we use a reference length of 100.

A is always at (0, 0)  
B is always at (0, 100)
the line from A to B is 0Â° in our grid

user A calibrates with B, only to set his angle correction relative to the grid
user B calibrates with A; this sets his correction angle

user B calibrates with C, so we can calculate the angle between AB and BC
user C calibrates with A an B, so we can calculate the angle between AC and BC

when we're done with these 3, we have a base triangle.

next joining users:
from here on, we'll call the joining user N; M refers to the user joining before N; O to the user joining after N.

we always know the length of AM
